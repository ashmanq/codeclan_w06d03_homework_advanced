# JavaScript Advanced Enumeration
This app demonstrates the ability to use JavaScript enumeration methods for reasonably complex problems. The brief for
this project was as follows:

## Brief
You have been given four projects, each containing a coding problem. You should write the code to make the tests pass, 
without modifying the spec files. You should use JavaScriptâ€™s built-in enumerator methods where appropriate. The aim was
to pass tests for the following types of finder:

* Uppercaser
* Pangram Finder
* Isogram Finder
* Anagram Finder

# Run Tests
To run the tests first install the node modules:
```JavaScript
npm install
```
Then type the following to run the tests:
```JavaScript
npm run test
```
